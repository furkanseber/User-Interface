# User-Interface

• Home Page (/)
Header:
- New User button should be placed at the top left of the page. Those who click this button should be forwarded to the registration page.
- A checkbox should be placed on the side of the button to not show disabled users. This will affect the table below.
- A table should be created under the buttons as "Id - User Name - Email - Enabled". These texts should be near the left. Each table title should be prepared in a way that it can be filtered and the filter icon should be placed on the far right of the articles.
-Registered information should be written at the bottom of the table in order. IDs should be right aligned, User Name – Email – Enabled should be left aligned.
- Each user must have an ID and must not repeat, but increase sequentially.
- If the user is not disabled, it should return true in the enabled table. If disabled, return false.
